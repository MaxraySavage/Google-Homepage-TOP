# Google Homepage Notes

## Observations
There are four main components to the google homepage:
- Header
- Logo
- Search Form
- Footer

### Header
The header has some links and a sign in button.

On the left side we have ```About``` and ```Store```.

On the right ```Gmail Images``` then 9 circles arranged in a square and a blue sign in button.

The box of circles has a circle that appears behind it on mouse over.
The sign in is blue with full white text, and it changes color on mouse over.

### Logo
The distance from the top of the logo to the top of the page changes based on the height of the page. As I was experiementing with resizing the page I noticed that the logo only starts to pull away from the header after the page expands beyong 900 ish pixels in height.

### Search Form
The search form contains a text input field as well as a few buttons. The text input field has a magnifying glass icon on the right and when there is text in the form, an ```x``` appears on the right side.

The buttons and the text input field all get a shadow on mouse over.

### Footer
The footer has 
- Advertising
- Business
- How search works
- Carbon neutral since 2007
- Privacy
- Terms 
- Settings

The items in the footer stack over each other as the page size narrows.

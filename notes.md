# Google Homepage Notes

## Observations
There are 3 main components to the google homepage:
- Header
- Center Block
- Footer

Some other general observatyiosn:
```cursor: pointer``` on buttons/links

### Header
The header has some links and a sign in button.

On the left side we have "About" and "Store."

On the right "Gmail" "Images" 9 circles arranged in a square and a blue sign in button.

The box of circles has a little circle that appears behind it on mouse over
The sign in is blue with full white text, this color when moused over: #2b7de9, when (active) #63a0ef and when inactive (#1a73e8). 

### Center Block
The center block consists of:
- Logo
- Text Form
- Delete Text Icon (a little x)
- Search and Lucky Buttons

The distance from the top of the logo to the top of the page changes based on the height of the page. As I was experiementing with resizing the page I noticed that the logo only starts to pull away from the header after the page expands beyong 900 ish pixels in height.

### Footer
The footer has 
- Advertising
- Business
- How search works
- Carbon neutral since 2007
- Privacy
- Terms 
- Settings

The items in the footer stack over each other as the page size narrows.
